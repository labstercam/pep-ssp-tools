   - SharpCap Pro 4.1+
   
   **For Standalone Mode:**
   - IronPython 3.4+
   - Windows 10/11
   
   ## What's New in v0.1.2
   
   ### Filter Control (Major Enhancement)
   - Implemented automated 6-position filter slider control via serial commands
   - Added manual mode support with user prompts
   - Created Filter Bar Setup dialog (3 bars × 6 positions = 18 filters)
   - Added Auto/Manual Filters toggle in Setup menu
   - Implemented "Home" command to return slider to position 1
   - Added hardware verification dialog when switching to Auto mode
   - Fixed critical bug: Manual mode filter selection was falling through to Auto mode logic
   - Removed redundant Auto mode check after Manual mode handler
   
   ### PEP Star Catalog
   - Integrated 1000+ standard stars from Arne Henden's PEP catalog
   - Catalog search by star name with fuzzy matching
   - Filter by RA/Dec range and constellation
   - SharpCap coordinate synchronization (populate from current telescope pointing)
   - Johnson/Cousins UBVRI and Sloan ugriz filter system support
   
   ### SharpCap Integration
   - Windows now use Show() instead of ShowDialog() to keep SharpCap responsive
   - Launch window minimizes when opening SSP Data Acquisition
   - Launch window automatically restores when SSP window closes
   - Enhanced launcher with feature bullet points
   
   ### UI/UX Improvements
   - Launch window resized: 720×525 (20% wider, 5% taller)
   - Fixed line break issues in description text (Windows CRLF)
   - Status messages updated to reflect implemented features
   - Footer label repositioned to prevent clipping
   
   ### Documentation & Debugging
   - Added comprehensive console logging for filter commands
   - Updated QUICK_START.md with filter mode configuration section
   - Enhanced FILTER_CONTROL.md with hardware detection limitations
   - Added warnings about SSP firmware acknowledging commands without hardware
   
   ## Bug Fixes
   - Fixed Manual mode filter selection handler (was missing entirely)
   - Fixed line breaks in launcher description (required \r\n for Windows TextBox)
   - Fixed footer label clipping with window resize
   - Fixed potential recursion in filter combo box event handling
   
   ## Known Limitations
   - Fast mode not yet implemented
   - Very fast mode not yet implemented
   - SSP firmware cannot detect if automated filter slider hardware is physically present
   - User must manually configure Auto/Manual mode based on their hardware
   
   ## Important Notes
   
   ### Filter Hardware Detection
   **The SSP firmware will acknowledge filter commands even if automated filter hardware is not installed.** This is a hardware/firmware limitation, not a software bug. The software cannot detect hardware presence programmatically. Users must:
   - Verify their hardware configuration (manual vs. automated slider)
   - Select the correct mode in Setup → Auto/Manual Filters
   - Visually confirm filter movement when first enabling Auto mode
   
   See [FILTER_CONTROL.md](https://github.com/labstercam/pep-ssp-tools/blob/main/SharpCap-SSP/FILTER_CONTROL.md) for complete technical documentation.
