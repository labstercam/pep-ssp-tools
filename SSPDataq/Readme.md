## SSPDataq

Archive of Jerry Persha's SSPDataq 3 and 4 software. The SSP line of photometers made by Optec, Inc. for the last 30 years has made precision photometry possible for the small observatory astronomer- Optec sold a complete line of single channel photometers with various detectors that cover the spectrum from 320nm to 1.8 microns. SSPDataq software operates these photometers for the purpose photometer control, data acquisition and for final data reduction to standard magnitude. Data acquisition can be both manually operated or fully automated including telescope pointing with popular telescope mount control protocol. Data reduction to standard magnitudes takes into account first order extinction, second order extinction for b-v, transformation coefficients for all color bands, finally producing a magnitude in the UBVRIJH system with standard error reported- In addition to precision photometry of slow variables, data can also be acquired for fast events with integration times as short as 0.002 seconds possible with the SSP-5 PEP photometer.
